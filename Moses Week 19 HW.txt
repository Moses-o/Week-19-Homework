week 19 homework

Part 1: Windows Server Attack Log
1.
For universal mitigation, there could be a "whitelist" for IP addresses that are authorized for access. On top of whitelisting the IPs, there should be a multi-factor
authentication added for extra security.

	The first user to have an excess in signatures is user k. With user_k, the signature "An attempt was made to reset an accounts password" came up 2,021 times
compared to the account being locked out 11 times. This leads to a conclusion that the account lockout should be extended per suggested amount of login 
failures considering a 183 attempts to one lockout seems generous for anyone attempting to brute force.
	User_a's account has 1,694 counts of the account being locked out. This suggests that the password is very strong, but for extra security measures
other adjustments can be made to user_a's login such as the account name.
	For user_j, the alarming signature was the 302 count of successful logins. This would suggest that the password was easily cracked and the account has
already been comprimised. User_j should create a more complex password or even be subjected to consistent and frequent password changes.

The most ideal solution would be to track and blacklist the IP address of the malicious actor. This would alleviate the issues of the endpoint users by 
solving the problem from the very source.

Part 2: Apache Webserver Attack Log
1.
	The traffic is all located in Ukraine so it would be best to block incoming traffic from the country.

2.
	The first determining field I resorted to was user_agent. With the majority of traffic coming through 'Mozilla/4.0', it would be wise to block the
incoming traffic from specified field. Second field that was a potential target under the 'root' field. Since the files are the likely target, VSI should 
consider whitelisting specified IPs targetting the files.
